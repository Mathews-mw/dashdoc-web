					except I'm having them! Who are those horrible orange men? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? As an interesting side
					note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

					Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. I love you, buddy! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! I could if you hadn't

					Is that a cooking show? Why would a robot need to drink? Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then
					we'll go ride the bumper cars. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

					Bender, you risked your life to save me! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. We can't compete
					with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!
				</Text>
				<Text>
					That's not soon enough! Bender, you risked your life to save me! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and
					hitting them? We're rescuing ya. Okay, I like a challenge. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were
					supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Belligerent and numerous.
					Say what? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the
					octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got
					a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! She also liked to shut up! Please,
					Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! She also liked to shut up! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down
					with your children, and hitting them? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Oh, I always feared he might run off
					like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Why yes!
					Thanks for noticing. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.
					I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Bender, you risked your life to save me! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on
					between two consenting adults. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space,
					Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something
					you'd have to freebase. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? OK, this has
					gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to
					steal! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

					It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Who are those horrible orange men? As an interesting side
					note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. You are the last hope of the universe.

					There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and
					Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Anyone who laughs is a communist! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
					Can I use the gun? I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

					You know, I was God once. Fatal. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Hello Morbo, how's the family? You, minion.
					Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Kids
					don't turn rotten just from watching TV. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
					Tell her she looks thin. You are the last hope of the universe. I don't want to be rescued. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I've
					been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?

					Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Look, last night was a mistake. Who are those horrible orange men? Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Why am I sticky
					and naked? Did I miss something fun? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm
					involved. Really?! I'll get my kit! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't
					very… Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I
					mean get your coat. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Say it in Russian! I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of
					youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I''
					have to pay ''them'! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! I am Singing Wind, Chief
					of the Martians. What are their names? Noooooo! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Bite my shiny metal
					ass. Who am I making this out to? Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!k for more stuff to steal! Now Fry, it's been a few
					years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
